Known Issues
===
Drawer dissappears when the user swipes or scrolls outside the drawer, and it can't be restored.

Right/bottom PulloutDrawer cause broswer windows to scroll when hidden except in desktop Safari.

Pulltab position "center" isn't really centered.  It uses percentages to position offset from left or top and can look "not-centered" when resizing to smaller viewports.
